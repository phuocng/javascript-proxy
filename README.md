# Practical examples of using JavaScript Proxy

JavaScript Proxy is a powerful tool that allows you to customize and intercept object behavior. It lets you create a virtual layer on top of an object, which can be used for a variety of purposes, such as validation, caching, and security.

The Proxy object is a key feature of the JavaScript language and is widely used in modern web development. It enables you to define custom behavior for basic operations on an object, such as property access, assignment, and deletion. This allows you to create objects that behave in ways that are impossible with regular JavaScript objects.
In this series, we'll explore the basics of **JavaScript Proxy** and show you how to use it in practical situations. Get ready to take your JavaScript skills to the next level!
